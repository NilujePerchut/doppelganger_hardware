# USB Alien RevA0
_Niluje (c) 2018_

This is an attempt to provide an _any_ USB interface to the Doppelganger board.
This board replaces the BROOK fighting board on the Doppelganger.
You can for example, mount the Doppelganger and the USB alien inside a TE2 and 
plug the TE2 USB to the USB Alien. This will allow the Doppelganger to access 
the TE2 USB.
